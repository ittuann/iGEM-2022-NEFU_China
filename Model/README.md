# iGEM 2022 NEFU_China Open Project

This folder contains  all the 3D hardware models we have created (in STL format), and the complete SolidWorks project that used to create these models.

## 3D model in STL format

We have released four module independent 3D models in STL format. They are `Frame Module.STL`, `Pipette Module.STL`, `Robotic Arm Module.STL` and `Visual Identification Module.STL`.

We also released two complete 3D models of the hardware. `Hardware.STL` is the full version, `Hardware Lite.STL` is the lightweight version without the robot arm module.

The STL format is a widely used 3D model format. Most of the systems have built-in software to view the STL format. When you have downloaded the model, you can view it directly on your computer.

## Project 

We open source the entire project for designing and making 3D models. 

It requires specialized software SolidWorks 2021 to open.

With this open project, you can view every detail of our design, and modify the model as needed to use it in your work environment.
